@problem
1.  create wallet --> connect to XT && Pheonix wallet
    1 skip to screen 6
2.  screen 7 -> add eKYC
3.  gen NFT
    need attbribute for the NFTs
    
    flow:
        1. match a random NFTs in level 1 that not for sale
        2. assign it to a wallet address
        3. use wallet address to get the NFT ID and use it to search IPFS ID and attribute, do mapping for rendering the data
    


@reminder
1. Pheonix no 2 way communition, so can't indegrention
    直接寫phx wallet
2. can comment to say where can change
3. need to add ten times for picture to train models
4. face2bmi in hugging face
    can use gradio_client for API
5. check is there gender detection in face2mi
6. flow of sex:
    select sex -> affect BMI detecting
7. NFT catch alias get transaction ranking, active since, to gen the the number or bar and the name
