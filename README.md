@problem
1.  create wallet --> connect to XT && Pheonix wallet
    1 skip to screen 6
2.  screen 7 -> add eKYC
3.  gen NFT
    need attbribute for the NFTs
    
    flow:
        1. match a random NFTs in level 1 that not for sale
        2. assign it to a wallet address
        3. use wallet address to get the NFT ID and use it to search IPFS ID and attribute, do mapping for rendering the data

3. need to add ten times for picture to train models
4. face2bmi in hugging face
